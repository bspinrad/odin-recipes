    <h1>My Dad's Turkey Chili
        <img src="../img/mydadsturkeychili.jpg" alt="A bowl of chili with sides">
        <h2> A hearty and heart-healthy tomato-based chili</h2>
        <p>This delicious chili is perfect for a winter weeknight. It can be made with cheap, healthy ingredients and it makes a huge volume.
            Be sure to have a <em>large</em> stock pot on hand (6+ quarts). As someone who cooks for just myself, I love to make the full recipe and divvy up the portions for
            quick dinners later.
